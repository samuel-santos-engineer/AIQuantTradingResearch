# Testing Strategy Reference Implementation

## Purpose

Demonstrates a layered, risk-based testing strategy spanning unit,
domain, architecture, integration, contract, regression, end-to-end,
security, and CI validation.

This document is a concrete reference implementation within the AI
Engineering Toolkit. It translates authoritative engineering guidance
into an implementation model that engineers and AI coding agents can
inspect, adapt, validate, and review.

A reference implementation demonstrates one strong solution. It does not
replace the standards, architecture, playbooks, prompt guidance, or
repository-specific requirements that govern real work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Objectives

This reference implementation aims to:

-   Convert engineering guidance into a concrete and reviewable example.
-   Make important boundaries and responsibilities explicit.
-   Demonstrate production-oriented quality without unnecessary
    framework building.
-   Provide repeatable validation and acceptance criteria.
-   Support both human engineering and AI-assisted execution.
-   Keep security, maintainability, documentation, and testing part of
    the implementation contract.
-   Produce evidence that the demonstrated outcome is correct.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scope

The scope is intentionally focused on the engineering concerns
represented by this reference. Application-specific choices should be
introduced only when they are necessary to demonstrate those concerns.

The reference should be:

-   Self-contained enough to study independently.
-   Small enough to understand.
-   Realistic enough to matter.
-   Buildable or executable where applicable.
-   Testable where behavior can be verified.
-   Safe to run in a local development environment.
-   Traceable to applicable Toolkit guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Authority Model

When guidance conflicts, use the following conceptual priority:

``` text
Explicit Task Requirements
        ↓
Repository Architecture
        ↓
Engineering Standards
        ↓
Applicable Playbooks
        ↓
Prompt Quality Guidelines
        ↓
Reference Implementations
        ↓
Existing Local Patterns
        ↓
Agent Preference
```

Reference implementations therefore provide context and examples without
silently becoming policy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Testing Principles

Testing Principles is part of the reference contract because it
contributes directly to the implementation's ability to be understood,
executed, reviewed, and maintained.

The reference should demonstrate the following expectations:

-   Test behavior at the cheapest reliable boundary.
-   Use higher-level tests for integration risk rather than duplicating
    unit coverage.
-   Treat deterministic execution and actionable failures as quality
    requirements.
-   Document important assumptions and tradeoffs.
-   Provide automated evidence where the requirement can be verified
    mechanically.
-   Avoid introducing complexity that is unrelated to the concept being
    demonstrated.

A useful engineering flow is:

``` text
Intent
  ↓
Applicable Guidance
  ↓
Implementation Decision
  ↓
Executable Change
  ↓
Validation Evidence
  ↓
Review
```

The implementation remains an example. Standards, architecture,
playbooks, and explicit task requirements retain authority over the
example when conflicts occur.

### Design Expectations

The design should make responsibilities and boundaries discoverable from
repository structure, names, documentation, and tests. Important
behavior must not depend on undocumented conversation history or
developer-specific machine state.

### Validation Expectations

Validation should answer three questions:

1.  Was the intended behavior implemented?
2.  Were applicable engineering constraints preserved?
3.  Is there objective evidence that another engineer or coding agent
    can reproduce the result?

Where automated validation is not practical, the reference should
identify the required review evidence explicitly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Test Architecture

Test Architecture is part of the reference contract because it
contributes directly to the implementation's ability to be understood,
executed, reviewed, and maintained.

The reference should demonstrate the following expectations:

-   Define the responsibility of test architecture explicitly.
-   Prefer deterministic, reviewable behavior over hidden conventions.
-   Keep implementation choices traceable to applicable Toolkit
    guidance.
-   Document important assumptions and tradeoffs.
-   Provide automated evidence where the requirement can be verified
    mechanically.
-   Avoid introducing complexity that is unrelated to the concept being
    demonstrated.

## AI-Assisted Engineering Contract

When an AI coding agent uses this reference, the expected workflow is:

``` text
Inspect Repository
      ↓
Read Authoritative Guidance
      ↓
Confirm Scope and Boundaries
      ↓
Study Relevant Reference
      ↓
Plan
      ↓
Implement Incrementally
      ↓
Run Validation
      ↓
Report Evidence
      ↓
Human Review
```

The agent should not copy patterns blindly. It should first verify that
the pattern fits the current architecture, scope, technology, and
security requirements.

The agent should report:

-   Files created or modified.
-   Important design decisions.
-   Commands executed.
-   Tests and checks performed.
-   Validation results.
-   Warnings, assumptions, and unresolved risks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quality Gates

A reference implementation should not be considered complete merely
because its files exist.

Acceptance requires appropriate evidence for:

-   Structural correctness.
-   Build or execution success where applicable.
-   Automated tests where applicable.
-   Static analysis where applicable.
-   Architecture conformance.
-   Security expectations.
-   Documentation completeness.
-   Repeatability.
-   Reviewability.

The preferred model is:

``` text

    +
Automated Validation
    +
Security Review
    +
Documentation
    +
Human Review
    =
Accepted Reference
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Maintenance and Evolution

This reference should evolve when the authoritative Toolkit guidance it
demonstrates changes.

Maintenance should consider:

-   Deprecated tools or dependencies.
-   Superseded architectural practices.
-   New security requirements.
-   New validation capabilities.
-   Changes to AI-assisted engineering workflows.
-   Drift between documentation and executable behavior.

Changes should preserve backward understanding: a future maintainer
should be able to determine why the reference changed and which guidance
motivated the change.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [ ] Security requirements are preserved.
-   [ ] Tests cover meaningful behavior.
-   [ ] Validation can be reproduced.
-   [ ] Documentation matches the implementation.
-   [ ] AI-assisted changes include evidence rather than unsupported
    claims.
-   [ ] No reference-specific choice has accidentally been promoted into
    an undocumented global standard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Related Toolkit Areas

This reference should be interpreted together with the applicable:

-   Engineering Standards.
-   Bootstrap Playbooks.
-   PowerShell Playbooks.
-   GitHub Playbooks.
-   .NET Engineering Playbooks.
-   Prompt Framework.
-   Prompt Quality Guidelines.

guidance and implementation without creating a second source of
authority.

An engineer or AI coding agent should be able to determine:

-   What the implementation demonstrates.
-   Why its important decisions exist.
-   Which constraints govern it.
-   How to execute or inspect it.
-   How to validate it.
-   Which parts may be adapted.
-   Which parts must not be copied without contextual review.

Demonstrates a layered, risk-based testing strategy spanning unit,
domain, architecture, integration, contract, regression, end-to-end,
security, and CI validation.
